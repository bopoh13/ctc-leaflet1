Here are links to testing capabilities Leaflet 1.2.
The main problem is the problem of old browsers in that 
they do not display Canvas. Your phone you can test 
<a href="../test.html">the link</a>.

Below are the possibilities of Leaflet 1.2 for mapping
additional objects on the map:

1. [gpx](../examples/leaflet/gpx.html)
2. [gpx-no-wpt](../examples/leaflet/gpx-no-wpt.html)
3. [gpx-speed](../examples/leaflet/gpx-speed.html)
4. [marker-canvas](../examples/leaflet/marker-canvas.html)
5. [topojson](../examples/leaflet/topojson.html)
